'''
Write a program (function!) that takes a list and
returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

Extras:

Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

def removeDuplicates(a,b):
   lst = a
   [lst.append(i) for i in b if i not in lst]
   return lst

print(removeDuplicates(a,b))
